### Pros <br><br>

The P5.js library is free for anyone to use. In order to link P5.js, you only need to use script tags. No additional software will need to be installed. It's easy to learn and easy to pick up. It uses JavaScript, which is currently one of the most popular programming languages. P5.js is open-source and still under development, which means it is receiving updates as of right now. P5.js is an excellent tool for getting people interested in Javascript. This is a very good introduction tool.


### Cons <br><br>

There isn't a need for P5.js library, it's more for playground uses, which could lead to a decrease in interest and support for it.  The P5.js library is primarily used as a drawing tool. Beginners in coding might get the wrong impression from learning P5.js.
